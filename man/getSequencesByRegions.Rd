\title{Read multiple genome sequence data from user by inputting a vector of regions}
\usage{
getSequencesByRegions(regions)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{A vector of strings indicating the interested regions in
which SARS-COV2 are located that you want to study}
}
\value{
Returns a AAStringSet with sequences.
}
\description{
A function that takes regions as input. It will look up the accessionIDs of
SARS-COV2 of this region. Then it will retrieve the sequences from NCBI
database online and return as a AAStringSet object.
}
\examples{
# Example 1
# Load MT066156.1 (accessionID of SARS-COV2 in Italy) by
# using "Italy" as input
regions <- c("Italy", "Canada", "USA")
Sequence <- getSequencesByRegions(regions)

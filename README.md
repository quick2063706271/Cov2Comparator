# Cov2Comparator

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Cov2Comparator is to analyze SARS covid-2 genome across
different geographic regions including performing multiple sequence
alignments, phylogenetic tree and mutation analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Cov2Comparator from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("quick2063706271/Cov2Comparator", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("Cov2Comparator")
```

To run the shinyApp: Under construction

## Overview

``` r
ls("package:Cov2Comparator")
data(package = "Cov2Comparator") 
```

### Vignettes

``` r
browseVignettes("Cov2Comparator")
```

An overview of the package is illustrated below.

## Contribution

The author of this package is Kuai Yu. ***readGenome***,
***getSequenceByRegion***, ***getSequencesByRegions***,
***plotAlignment*** functions make use of ***Biostrings*** package for
converting fasta files and alignment to format DNAStringSet.
***getSequenceByRegion*** function also makes use of ***ape*** package
to download sequence from Genbank online. ***multipleSeqAlign***
function uses ***msa*** package to perform multiple sequence alignment.
***plotAlignment*** package function also uses ***pheatmap*** package to
plot the result. ***createTree*** function uses ***msa*** package to
convert data type, and ***seqinr*** to convert alignment to distance
matrix. Then ***ape*** package is used to create the tree. The
***plotTree*** function makes use of the ***graphic*** R package.

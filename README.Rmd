# Cov2Comparator

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Cov2Comparator is to analyze SARS covid-2 genome 
  across different geographic regions including performing multiple    sequence alignments, phylogenetic tree and mutation analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Cov2Comparator from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("quick2063706271/Cov2Comparator", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("Cov2Comparator")
```

## Overview
```r
ls("package:Cov2Comparator")
data(package = "Cov2Comparator") 
```

### Vignettes
```r
browseVignettes("Cov2Comparator")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Cov2Comparator)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
